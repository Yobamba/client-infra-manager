🛠 Phase 1: Backend "Final Polish"
CORS Config: Add CORSMiddleware to app/main.py to allow the React dev server (port 5173) to communicate with FastAPI.

Dependency Audit: Verify requirements.txt includes bcrypt==4.0.1 and passlib[bcrypt].

Cleanup: Remove all DEBUG print statements and commented-out "evil twin" code from the auth.py migration.

Seed Check: Run seed_admin.py on a fresh app.db to ensure the "Quick Start" works for the recruiter.

⚛️ Phase 2: Frontend Setup (React + TS)
Project Init: Initialize the frontend using Vite: npm create vite@latest client -- --template react-ts.

Axios/Fetch Setup: Create a base API instance with a request interceptor to automatically attach the JWT token to headers.

Auth Context: Build a useAuth hook to handle login, logout, and storing the token in localStorage.

🎨 Phase 3: Core UI Development
Login Page: Simple form to POST to /login and save the token.

Project Dashboard:

Admin View: See all projects.

User View: See only assigned projects (testing the isolation logic you just built!).

Instance Manager: A view for each project to list instances and a toggle to "Activate" an instance (testing the Single Production Rule).

📹 Phase 4: Submission Preparation
README: Write a concise guide on how to run the backend, seed the admin, and start the frontend.

Demo Video: Record a 3-5 minute walkthrough highlighting the RBAC and Business Rules.
